Hello,
This is Fotag, the 3rd assignment project for CS349 that i took in Spring 2018 under Professor Jeff Avery which is meant to demonstrate the MVC architecture. 
I used Windows as my development platform and the entire application is coded up in Java 10.0.1
Fotag is an image gallery developed in Java and is meant to demonstrate responsive GUIs, with support for Image rating(ranking), filtering the images based on rating, and saving/loading of the previous sessions. To build and run, simply run the command in the fotag folder:
./gradlew run (for linux)
or
gradlew.bat run (for windows)

To start a new session you might want to delete the file with name "savefile" in the fotag folder as well.
Thanks for trying this app out! Enjoy!
